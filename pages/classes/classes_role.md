## Introduction

The Role class is the basis for the _actor--role_ system of managing users and how they interact with the application.

It follows a similar pattern to IAM systems, where one [Actor](/classes_actor) can be assigned and granted new roles which allow them to interact with the application in specific ways through that role's methods.

Roles have a confirmation status and generate their own confirmation codes. Roles need to be confirmed independently of actors. The following example illustrates a situation in which this would be useful.

_A tow truck driver is using the application to serve customers. His [tow truck company](/classes_tow_truck_fleet) signs up with SafeTow to manage their entire fleet through the application. The tow truck driver is invited to become a [manager for the tow truck company](/classes_tow_truck_fleet_manager). The main manager on the account needs to be able to evaluate if the driver has confirmed his access and has accessed the dashboard to manage the organization._
